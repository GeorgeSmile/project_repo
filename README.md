# mini_project files and test files associated with the project tasks for the Data Engineering Generation course.

This project is designed as an interactive interface to create, update and read customer orders.
This will be a useful source when adding, manipulating and deleting data in duture via SQL and other database management software.

HOW-TO:
---------
Run main.py and follow the input commands when prompted.
Check files 'couriers_dict', 'orders_dict' and 'drinks_dict' to see changes made after user input.

REQUIREMENTS:
---------
- VSCode, Pycharm or any other IDE/program that can execute and read Python files.
- Pandas (library used for managing database tools/files with Python.)
- CSV library import
- sys, operator and (maybe) JSON imports.

DESIGN:
---------
I followed the Project_week sheets and googled any issues and problems I came across, or if there was a method I wanted to implement adn did not know how to do it.
I collaborated with other students, discovering new methods as we learned together. 
I dedicated 1 hour of project time after our classes for the day had ended. Although some days I was unable to commit to this.

I was unable to meet the requirements for unit-testing as I was focused on getting everything else done and understanding things properly, I did not have time to go abck to this subject.


HAD MORE TIME:
---------
If I had more time on this project I would have used it to understand and implement unit-testing. As I was unfortunately unable to do this, I cannot present demonstrable knowledge of this.

I would also spend more time learning more about the usage of pandas with CSV and other data files/formats. Furthermore I would like to learn more about CSV files and how to use them more efficiently. There was certain things I was unable to figure out, or overlooked, such as being able to see index/row numbers for my product list (drinks_dict).

I was also experimenting with a basket menu for customers for before they make an order. However this overcomplicated things, therefore I put it to one side. I would have like to explored this more, although it was not a requirement for the project.

WHAT DID I MOST ENJOY:
---------
- I enjoyed sharing ideas and solutions with others.
- Solving coding problems independently.
- Producing my own coding project, with a clear drive in how/where to move it forward.
- Discovering ways of handling data with Python.
